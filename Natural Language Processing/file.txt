When I worked at New York City, I took the fast train from New Jersey to work early in the morning. Thankfully , I was an early riser and heard my alarm go off since I was a light sleeper. Before heading out for a busy work day, I always made the effort to make my bed. Even though I work at New York, to live there is a tough task. Comparitively, New Jersey offers much more peaceful enviromnent to live. Thanks to the fast train, My work-personal lives are now balanced. New York is the definition of a city that never sleeps. The city has a strange feel of both being alive and dead at the same time. New Jersey unlike New York feels pleasent. I met a person yesterday in the fast train who almost lives the same life as mine. My wife unlike me isin't a light sleeper. She works as a teacher in New Jersey.
